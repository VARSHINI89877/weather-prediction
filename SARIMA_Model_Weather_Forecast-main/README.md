# SARIMA_Model_Weather_Forecast

SARIMA Model :- A effective machine learning technique for weather prediction 
Making forecasts or projections about future events or conditions based on historical and current data is the process of forecasting. It is an important tool for decision-making in many fields, including business, economics, finance, and weather forecasting, among others.the goal of forecasting is to reduce uncertainty about the future and provide meaning information that can guide strategic planning and decision-making
SARIMA model is a powerful ML technique for weather forecasting, used as a time-series model which can identify seasonal trends and patterns in weather data and provide precise forecasts for future time periods. Through the analysis of historical weather data and the application of SARIMA model, we can gain valuable information in the patterns and trends in weather patterns. This information can be used to develop effective strategies for managing weather-related risks and enhancing public safety. In terms of future work, there are several directions that could be pursued. Firstly, SARIMA model can be further optimized by incorporating more sophisticated ML methods like deep learning, ensemble models, or hybrid models. Secondly, incorporating more data sources, such as satellite data or weather station data, can lead to even more accurate predictions.

## Model Features ##

This Weather Forecasting App is a Python application that provides current weather information and future weather forecasts for a specified city. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and utilizes time series analysis to predict future temperatures. The app features a very simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
